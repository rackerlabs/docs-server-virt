==================================================
Migrate a workload to VMware Server virtualization
==================================================

When you become a Rackspace Technology customer, you might already 
have VMs operating in other environments that you want to migrate to 
Rackspace VMware Server Virtualization. Rackspace Technology offers 
the following options to assist with that migration. 

* **Customer Managed Migration:** We can provision new VMs for you to 
perform manual data migration.

You can send physical media to us to import existing OVA/OVF file(s) 
into your VMware Server Virtualization environment. Unless you reconfigure 
the VMs to meet Rackspace Technology managed support standards, 
these imports are considered Managed VMs with an Unsupported OS. 
For more information about the reconfiguration process, 
consult your account team.

* **Professional Services Migration:** You can work with our Professional 
Services team to design, plan, and migrate existing workloads into 
VMware Server Virtualization environments. Refer to Professional Services 
for more information on Professional Services [link] engagements.
