Understanding hypervisors
=========================

A hypervisor is an OS that runs on a physical server and pools the 
available physical resources into the virtual resources that VMs require. 
You use a hypervisor to run and manage your VMs. This document refers to 
VMware ESXi™, which is a type of hypervisor. The word hypervisor can also 
refer to the physical machine on which ESXi is installed.
