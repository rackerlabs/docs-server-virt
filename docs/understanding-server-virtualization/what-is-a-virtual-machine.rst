What is a Virtual Machine
==============================

A VM is software that mimics the behavior of a stand-alone computer. 
You can use a VM to:

* Install an operating system
* Install and run applications

Instead of physical hardware, a VM uses virtual hardware such as 
virtual CPU (vCPU), virtual RAM (vRAM), virtual network interface card (vNIC), 
and virtual disks (vDisk) to complete operations. Because a single 
physical device can include multiple VMs, using VMs helps you to 
optimize hardware resources.
