=============
ESXi patching
=============

Subject to technical eligibility, or if you are running or at risk of 
running an unsupported ESXi version, we might proactively upgrade your 
hypervisor to a newer ESXi version. If we plan to proactively upgrade 
you, we notify you in accordance with the 
Dedicated Hosting Terms and Conditions.

We also work with you to perform VMware ESXi upgrades at your request 
or to address critical vulnerabilities. 

Because your VMware Server Virtualization configuration can vary, 
we recommend reaching out to your account team to discuss upgrade 
options that best suit your environment and needs.
