Manage hypervisor storage
=========================

The amount and type of storage you require on a hypervisor can change
over time based on your storage needs. To accommodate additional
applications and data, you can expand LUNs, local storage, and a
VMFS datastore.

While we cannot automatically shrink storage resources, we do
provide a workaround for situations where you need to reduce
storage capacity.

This section includes the following topics:

- :ref:`Expand LUNs <expand-luns>`
- :ref:`Shrink hypervisor storage <shrink-hypervisor-storage>`
- :ref:`Expand VMFS datastore <expand-vmfs-datastore>`
- :ref:`Manage host bus adapters <manage-host-bus-adapters>`
