==================
Manage port groups
==================


A port group is a logical construct on the vSwitch to which vNICs can connect.
Refer to :ref:`understanding-port-groups` for more information about
port groups.

We manage port groups for you, including:

* Adding port groups
* Removing port groups
* Editing a VLAN ID
* Renaming a port group
  
If you require us to take any of the preceding actions, open a
Rackspace Technology ticket and indicate what action you want us to perform.

**Note:** Some port group tasks might require a maintenance window.
