Manage uplinks
==============

An uplink is the physical interface between the hypervisor and the physical
switch. Refer to Understanding uplinks for more information about uplinks.

We manage your uplinks for you, including:

* Adding an uplink to a vSwitch
* Removing an uplink from a vSwitch
* Editing the priority of an uplink
* Moving a cable to a different port on the hypervisor
* Moving a cable to a different port on the physical switch, or to a
  different physical switch

If you require us to take any of the preceding actions, open a
Rackspace Technology ticket and indicate what action you want us to perform.

**Note:** Some uplink tasks might require a maintenance window.
