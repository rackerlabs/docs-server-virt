Add or remove a vSwitch
=======================


A vSwitch, a virtual switch that provides a link between uplinks and port
groups, can use multiple uplinks and manage multiple port groups. Refer to
:ref:`understanding-vswitches` for more information about vSwitches.

To add or remove a vSwitch, open a Rackspace Technology ticket and
request a consultation.

**Note:** We cannot remove switches that we have pre-configured for you.
