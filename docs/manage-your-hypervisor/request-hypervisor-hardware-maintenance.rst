Subject to compatibility, terms, and cost, we can perform routine hardware 
maintenance tasks on your hypervisor chassis, including upgrading firmware, 
managing the local RAID array, and replacing the battery.

To request maintenance, contact your Rackspace Technology account team. 
We complete chassis-related work during a planned maintenance window.
