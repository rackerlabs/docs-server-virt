====================
Upgrade ESXi version
====================

We offer major ESXi version upgrades for your ESXi hosts and minor patches, 
such as bug fixes and security updates. Depending on your configuration, 
upgrading your ESXi host might require downtime for some VMs. The upgrade 
might also negatively impact VM performance. Because system performance can 
be negatively impacted, we usually upgrade ESXi hosts during a planned 
maintenance window.

**Note:** Because we test ESXi releases internally and make updates to our 
automation and infrastructure, we might not offer the latest major ESXi 
release until we complete testing with our infrastructure.

To upgrade your ESXi version, open a Rackspace Technology ticket and request 
an upgrade. If your environment is eligible for an automated upgrade, 
we contact you via a ticket and proceed with the upgrade.

If your ESXi version is close to or beyond the end-of-support date, 
we open a ticket and notify you that you should upgrade. If you do not 
respond to that ticket, and if your environment is eligible to be updated 
without shutting down VMs, we inform you of our plan and perform the upgrade.
