===================================
Migrate to a new hypervisor chassis
===================================

Subject to compatibility, terms, and cost, we can migrate your environment 
to a different Hypervisor chassis. You might need to migrate to a new chassis 
to run the latest version of ESXi, support the most recent driver, 
or when the current chassis has reached end-of-support.

Depending on the impact to your environment, we can migrate your chassis 
during a planned maintenance window or as an emergency change. If your 
hypervisor belongs to a cluster, you must migrate all hypervisors in the 
cluster to a new chassis.

To migrate your hypervisor to a new chassis, contact your 
Rackspace Technology account team.
