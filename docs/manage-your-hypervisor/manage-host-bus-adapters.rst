Manage host bus adapters
========================

A host bus adapter (HBA) is hardware that you need for fiber channel storage, 
such as shared SAN and dedicated SAN. If you currently only have standalone 
hypervisors with local storage and want to use SAN, we can install HBAs in 
each of your hypervisors. Installing HBAs comes at an additional cost, and 
we install them during a maintenance window.

To add an HBA, contact your Rackspace Technology account team and identify 
the hypervisors for which you want us to add or remove HBAs. We usually 
perform this work in a planned maintenance window.
