Manage Rackspace Technology Portal users
========================================

Because the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal supports multiple
offerings, we have documented the instructions for managing users in a
separate guide. Refer to
`Manage user permissions for Dedicated Hosting
<https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/manage-user-permissions-for-dedicated-hosting/>`_.
for instructions about managing user permissions.

Credentials management
______________________



For supported VMs and in accordance with ISO27001 requirements,
we maintain a formal policy for credentials to your environment.
These credentials give us the ability to provide managed services
and enable automation.

While you have full administrator access to modify VM passwords and
accounts as necessary, we advise against making changes to
the Rackspace Technology account to avoid impacting your support
experience. If you do make changes, open a ticket to ensure that
we are aware of the changes.
