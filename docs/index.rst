About Rackspace Server Virtualization
=====================================

Rackspace Server Virtualization is a managed VMware® vSphere environment
that enables you to offload the maintenance and monitoring of the
infrastructure, VMware stack, and guest operating system layer to a
Rackspace Technology team of VMware Certified Professionals who are experts
in storage, networking, and infrastructure.

Rackspace VMware Server Virtualization runs on VMware vSphere,
which allows you to consolidate the hardware requirements for higher
capacity utilization and benefit from greater efficiency. You can also
take advantage of features not available in traditional environments such
as snapshots, vMotion and Storage vMotion, quicker workload provisioning,
and less impactful hardware maintenance processes.

This Solution Guide provides conceptual information and procedural
instructions you can use to manage your VMware Server Virtualization
environment. This guide contains the following chapters:
