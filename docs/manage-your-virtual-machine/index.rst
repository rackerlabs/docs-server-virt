Manage your virtual machine
===========================

Managing your VM includes provisioning VMs, deleting VMs, and making
changes to your VMs.

While you can use the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal to complete
many VM management tasks, there are some tasks that we must perform
for you. We’ve included step-by-step instructions for all tasks that
you can perform. For tasks that you cannot complete, we provide a list
of the information you should include in your ticket so that we can
expedite your request.
