===========

To free up space, you can delete a VM when you no longer need it. Deleting
the VM deletes all data stored on it, all applications, the OS,
and any configurations. Deleting a VM is permanent and irreversible.

1.	Log in to the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal and click
    **Products > VMware Server Virtualization**.
2.	On the list of virtual machines, select the virtual machine that
    you want to delete. This action opens the virtual machine's details.
3.	Click **Actions > Delete VM**.
4.	Enter any Special Instructions to include in the support ticket.
5.	Click **Request Deletion**.
This action creates a ticket for your Rackspace VMware Support team to
take action.

**Note:** You can also click the *cog* icon next to the VM on the
**Virtual Machine** list to access the **Actions** drop-down menu.
