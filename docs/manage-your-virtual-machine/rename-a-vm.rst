===========
Rename a VM
===========

You can give your VM a meaningful name, which can be useful when you 
re-purpose your VM.

VM names must begin with the Rackspace Technology device number, 
a six- or seven-digit unique serial number. We require that naming 
convention because it helps us quickly locate your VM and facilitates 
the communication between you and us.

When you request a VM name change, we change it on all layers, including the Guest OS hostname, the VMware container, and the device name that appears in the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal.
To rename a VM, open a Rackspace Technology ticket and provide the following information:
•	Current VM name.
•	New VM name.
