Reboot a VM
===========

Sometimes an application or the OS prompts you to reboot a VM. You can
reboot a VM from within the OS, but if you have lost access to the OS or
the OS is not responding, you can use
the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal to reboot the VM.

Complete the following steps to reboot a VM:

1. Log in to the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal and click
**Products > VMware Server Virtualization**.
2. On the list of virtual machines, select the virtual machine you want
to reboot.
This action opens the virtual machine's details. \

3.	Click **Actions > Reboot VM**.
4.	Choose one of the following options:
    * **Soft Reboot**: Graceful shutdown and restart of your server's \
        operating system (recommended).
    * **Hard Reboot**: Forcefully power-cycle your VM. This might
        produce undesired consequences, and you should use it only as a
        last resort. You need to specify a reason for a Hard Reboot from
        the dropdown list.
5.	Click **Reboot Virtual Machine**. \
