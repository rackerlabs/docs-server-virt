==============================================
Upgrade virtual hardware compatibility version
==============================================

The virtual hardware compatibility version is the VM version that specifies 
the ESXi host versions with which the VM is compatible. VMs with newer 
virtual hardware compatibility versions have increased limits for the 
virtual hardware you can allocate.

New virtual hardware compatibility versions are available with 
new ESXi releases.

To request an upgrade to the virtual hardware compatibility version, 
open a Rackspace Technology ticket and specify the VM you want to upgrade. 
We work with you to schedule the upgrade.
