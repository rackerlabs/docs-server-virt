Change the association between a vNIC a port group
==================================================

To connect a virtual network card to a different network segment, you can 
request that we change the association between a vNIC and a port group. 
Refer to Understanding port groups for more information about port groups.[link] 

You cannot change the association between a vNIC and port group yourself. 
You must create a ticket and request that we change the association for you.

To change the association between a vNIC and a port group, create a 
Rackspace Technology ticket that includes the following information:

* The name of the VM and the vNIC you want to change.
* The name of the port group to which you want to associate the vNIC.
   
**Note:** When changing the association between a vNIC and a port group, 
we must change IPs, which can result in downtime.
