Appendix 1: Licensing
=====================

Licensing is handled in several ways for VMware Server Virtualization.

**VMware licensing:** VMware vSphere licensing is leased through Rackspace 
Technology and installed during provisioning.

**Windows licensing:** Customers can provide their own Windows OS and SQL 
licensing or lease Rackspace Technology-provided Windows licenses. 
If you lease Windows licensing from Rackspace Technology, we activate the license.

**Red Hat licensing:** Customers can provide their own OS licenses or lease a 
Rackspace Technology-provided Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) OS license. 
If you lease OS licensing from Rackspace Technology, we can activate it with the 
Rackspace Technology Red Hat Network (RHN) server.

**Database licensing:** Customers can provide their own database licenses or lease 
Rackspace Technology-provided database licensing.
